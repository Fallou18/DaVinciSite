                    <h4>1. Data protection principles</h4>
                    <p>The Association Leonardo Da Vinci (The association) is committed to processing data in accordance
                        with its responsibilities under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (herein after GDPR).
                    </p>
                    <p>Article 5 of the GDPR requires that personal data shall be:
                    <p>a. processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;</p>
                    <p>b. collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a
                        manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in
                        the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall
                        not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;</p>
                    <p>c. adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they
                        are processed;</p>
                    <p>d. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
                        that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are
                        processed, are erased or rectified without delay;</p>
                    <p>e. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary
                        for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for
                        longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in
                        the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject
                        to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR
                        in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and</p>
                    <p>f. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including
                        protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction
                        or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.”</p>

                    </p>

                    <h4>2. General provisions</h4>
                    <p>a. This policy applies to all personal data processed by The Association.</p>
                    <p>b. The Responsible Person shall take responsibility for the The Association’s ongoing compliance
                        with this policy.</p>
                    <p>c. This policy shall be reviewed at least annually.</p>
                    <p>d. The Association shall register with the Information Commissioner’s Office as an organisation
                        that processes personal data.</p>

                    <h4>3. Lawful, fair and transparent processing</h4>
                    <p>a. To ensure its processing of data is lawful, fair and transparent, The Association shall
                        maintain a Register of Systems.
                        <br>
                        b. The Register of Systems shall be reviewed at least annually.
                        <br>
                        c. Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests made to the
                        charity shall be dealt with in a timely manner.
                    </p>
                   
                    <h4>4. Lawful purposes</h4>
                    <p>
                        a. All data processed by The Association must be done on one of the following lawful bases:
                        consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interests.
                        <br>
                        b. The Association shall note the appropriate lawful basis in the Register of Systems.
                        <br>
                        c. Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in
                        consent shall be kept with the personal data.
                        <br>
                        d. Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the
                        individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to
                        ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in the The Association’s systems.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>5. Data minimisation</h4>
                    <p>The Association shall ensure that personal data are adequate, relevant and limited to what is
                        necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.</p>
                    
                    <h4>6. Accuracy</h4>
                    <p>
                        a. The Association shall take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate.
                        <br>
                        b. Where necessary for the lawful basis on which data is processed, steps shall be put in place to ensure that personal data is kept up to date.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>7. Archiving / removal</h4>
                    <p>
                        a. To ensure that personal data is kept for no longer than necessary, The Association shall put in place an archiving policy for each area in which personal data is processed and review this process annually.
                        <br>
                        b. The archiving policy shall consider what data should/must be retained, for how long, and why.
                    </p>

                    <h4>8. Security</h4>
                    <p>

                        a. The Association shall ensure that personal data is stored securely using modern software that
                        is kept-up-to-date.
                        <br>
                        b. Access to personal data shall be limited to personnel who need access and appropriate
                        security should be in place to avoid unauthorised sharing of information.
                        <br>
                        c. When personal data is deleted this should be done safely such that the data is irrecoverable.
                        <br>
                        d. Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions shall be in place.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>9. Breach</h4>
                    <p>In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
                        alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, The Association shall
                        promptly assess the risk to people’s rights and freedoms and if appropriate report this breach
                        to the ICO.</p>
